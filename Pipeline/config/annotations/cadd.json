	"description": "Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) is a tool for scoring the deleteriousness of single nucleotide variants as well as insertion/deletions variants in the human genome.  CADD is also a framework that integrates multiple annotations into one metric by contrasting variants that survived natural selection with simulated mutations.  CADD-scores strongly correlate with allelic diversity, pathogenicity of both coding and non-coding variants, and experimentally measured regulatory effects, and also highly rank causal variants within individual genome sequences.",
