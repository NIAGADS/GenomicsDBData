In stage 1, IGAP used genotyped and imputed data on 11,480,632 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to meta-analyse GWAS datasets consisting of 21,982 Alzheimer's disease cases and 41,944 cognitively normal controls from four consortia: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC); The European Alzheimer's disease Initiative (EADI); The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE); and The Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD Consortium Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD/Defining Genetic, Polygenic and Environmental Risk for Alzheimer's Disease Consortium (GERAD/PERADES). In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,362 Alzheimer's disease cases and 10,483 controls. Although the individual datasets examined excluded any SNPs with call rates <95%, IGAP meta-analysis only examined SNPs either genotyped or successfully imputed in at least 30% of the AD cases and 30% of the control samples across all datasets.",
